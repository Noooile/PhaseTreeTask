# Molecular Dynamics Trajectory Analysis & Optimization Assignment

This codebase aims to fulfill the assignment I was given as part of my application to PhaseTree.

## Usage

To use this code, you simply need to import the following:

```Python
from trajectory import Trajectory
```

For further explanations and examples, please refer to the [**documentation**](https://phasetreetask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Content

The Python code can be found under the `src` folder. The `res` folder contains the data file given for the task, as well as the plots and gif. The Python environment used to write the code can be cloned using the YAML file under the `config` folder.

The [technical note](note.md) can be found in the root folder.
